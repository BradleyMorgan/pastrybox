# Forking The Pastry Box Project

## Important Note: Limitations

As you can understand, not *everything* can be used freely.

None of the material directly related to bakers, and located in the <code>bakers</code> folder of this project -and filed under the relevant year- can be used outside the scope of sending pull requests. The pictures used for bakers’ profiles are their sole property and cannot be used without their agreement. This also applies to their biographies.

It’s also worth noting that, likewise, any thought published on [http://the-pastry-box-project.net](http://the-pastry-box-project.net) is copyrighted material and is the sole property of its author.

To put things more simply: what applies on [http://the-pastry-box-project.net/bakers](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/bakers) (or on Twitter, or any other social application for that matter) also applies when you fork The Pastry Box Project.
