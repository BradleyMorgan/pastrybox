<p>Ben is from Cambridge in the UK, but now lives in San Francisco working as a front-end developer at <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. There, he builds things for the platform and API groups. Ben also writes about the web on his <a href="http://benward.me/">personal blog</a>, and about food with his friends from London at <a href="http://munchmun.ch/">Munch Munch</a>, a food blog they founded in 2008. He's involved in <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats.org</a>, where he writes and edits specifications and assists as a community administrator. He collects vinyl, loves cheese, cooks pretty well, and has really wished he had some time to redesign his blog for about 5 years now.</p>
